text=[ "My family's gone; there's no one home.",
        "It's only me who's home alone.",
        "I shouldn't hear a single squeak.",
        "There shouldn't even be a creak,",

        "So what's that thumping that I hear?",
        "It must mean one thing: death is near.",
        "You're an adult, you'll be just fine.",
        "I tell myself as I dial nine",

        "Was that a knock upon the door?",
        "My heart beats faster than before",
        "I know it's closed; I've checked the lock.",
        "At least my killer knows to knock?",

        "I cannot sleep, though I'm in bed.",
        "I've made amends with God instead.",
        "If He decides that it's my time,",
        "Then this will be my very last rhyme.",

        "I hear a bang and then a break.",
        "My head shoots up; there's no mistake!",
        "I turn my music volume high",
        "So I won't hear the way I die.",

        "I run upstairs, desk lamp in hand.",
        "Over my head, ready to land,",
        "And right before it did just that",
        "I remembered - I have a cat"]

#poem 2
text=["Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?",
"Thou art more lovely and more temperate:",
"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,",
"And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;",
"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,",
"And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;",
"And every fair from fair sometime declines,",
"By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;",
"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,",
"Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;",
"Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,",
"When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:",
"So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,",
"So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",]

#poem 3
text=["Whose woods these are I think I know.",   
        "His house is in the village though;",   
        "He will not see me stopping here",   
        "To watch his woods fill up with snow.",   

        "My little horse must think it queer",   
        "To stop without a farmhouse near",   
        "Between the woods and frozen lake",   
        "The darkest evening of the year.",   

        "He gives his harness bells a shake ", 
        "To ask if there is some mistake. ",  
        "The only other sound’s the sweep ",  
        "Of easy wind and downy flake.",   

        "The woods are lovely, dark and deep,", 
        "But I have promises to keep,",   
        "And miles to go before I sleep,",   
        "And miles to go before I sleep."]
#poem 4
text=["You may write me down in history","With your bitter, twisted lies,","You may trod me in the very dirt",
      "But still, like dust, I'll rise.","
        "Does my sassiness upset you?",
        "Why are you beset with gloom?",
        "’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells",
        "Pumping in my living room.",
        "Just like moons and like suns,",
        "With the certainty of tides,",
        "Just like hopes springing high,",
        "Still I'll rise."]
#poem 5
text=["There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,",
      "And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;","And frogs in the pools singing at night,",
      "And wild plum trees in tremulous white;","Robins will wear their feathery fire","Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;",
      "And not one will know of the war, not one","Will care at last when it is done.","Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,","If mankind perished utterly;",
      "And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn","Would scarcely know that we were gone."]
#poem 6
text=[ "O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done;",
        "The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won;",
        "The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,",
        "While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:",

        "But O heart! heart! heart!",
        "O the bleeding drops of red,",
        "Where on the deck my Captain lies,",
        "Fallen cold and dead."]
#poem 7
text=["Some say the world will end in fire,",
        "Some say in ice.",
        "From what I’ve tasted of desire",
        "I hold with those who favor fire.",
        "But if it had to perish twice,",
        "I think I know enough of hate",
        "To say that for destruction ice",
        "Is also great",
        "And would suffice."]
#poem 8
text=[ "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,",
        "And sorry I could not travel both",
        "And be one traveler, long I stood",
        "And looked down one as far as I could",
        "To where it bent in the undergrowth;",
        "Then took the other, as just as fair,",
        "And having perhaps the better claim",
        "Because it was grassy and wanted wear,",
        "Though as for that the passing there",
        "Had worn them really about the same,",
        "And both that morning equally lay",
        "In leaves no step had trodden black.",
        "Oh, I kept the first for another day!",
        "Yet knowing how way leads on to way",
        "I doubted if I should ever come back.",
        "I shall be telling this with a sigh",
        "Somewhere ages and ages hence:",
        "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,",
        "I took the one less traveled by,",
        "And that has made all the difference."]
#poem 9
text=[ "Hold fast to dreams",

        "Frozen with snow."]
#poem 10
text=["I think that I shall never see",
        "A poem lovely as a tree.",
        "A tree whose hungry mouth is prest",
        "Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;",
        "A tree that looks at God all day,",
        "And lifts her leafy arms to pray;",
        "A tree that may in summer wear",
        "A nest of robins in her hair;",
        "Upon whose bosom snow has lain;",
        "Who intimately lives with rain.",
        "Poems are made by fools like me,",
        "But only God can make a tree."]
#poem 11
text=["I met a traveller from an antique land",
    "Who said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stone",
    "Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,",
    "Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,",
    "And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,",
    "Tell that its sculptor well those passions read",
    "Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,",
    "The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.",
    "And on the pedestal these words appear —",
    "“My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:",
    "Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”",
    "Nothing beside remains. Round the decay",
    "Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare",
    "The lone and level sands stretch far away."]

#poem 12
text=["If you can keep your head when all about you",

        "If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,",
        "Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,",
        "Or being hated don’t give way to hating,",
        "And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;",

        "And treat those two impostors just the same:.",
        "If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken",
        "Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,",
        "Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,",
        "And stoop and build’em up with worn-out tools;",
        "If you can make one heap of all your winnings",
        "And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,",
        "And lose, and start again at your beginnings,",
        "And never breathe a word about your loss:",
        "If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew",
        "To serve your turn long after they are gone,",
        "And so hold on when there is nothing in you",
        "Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on! ‘",
        "If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,",
        "Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,",
        "If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,",
        "If all men count with you, but none too much:",
        "If you can fill the unforgiving minute",
        "With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,",
        "Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,",
        "And- -which is more- -you’ll be a Man, my son!"]

#poem 13
text=["Remember me when I am gone away,",
