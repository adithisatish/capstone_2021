1. Some pronouns like "she", "me","her" etc are not recognized by WordNet while finding synsets. 
2. No other function/library to perform Wu-Palmer similarity except for WordNet
3. A lot of false positives, like a LOT, especially with adjective metaphors (identifies everything as a metaphor)
4. Context is not taken into consideration in the algorithm 
5. Proper nouns don't have synsets => cannot be detected


Note: Pronouns pose an issue in general as there is no context. 
For example, "he barked at Sam loudly" could either be literal if the "he" was a dog, or metaphorical if "he" was a person
