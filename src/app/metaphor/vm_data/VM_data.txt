She ate her feelings.
Broken in flight, the bird scythed down to the waiting moor.
He cut his friend off mid sentence.
I carried his name.
Inflation ate all my savings
He shot down all of my arguments.
My heart fills with pleasure
My heart dances with daffodils.
The breaking news stirred my excitement
The views she held were downright disgusting.
She held views that were downright disgusting.
His head was spinning with ideas
It's raining cats and dogs
She melted into his arms when he apologized.
She watched in horror as the dead bird floated down from the sky.
