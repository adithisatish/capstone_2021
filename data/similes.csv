Two is the beginning of the end,N
"Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one",N
"She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth",N
"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner",Y
"Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr",N

"Wendy came first, then John, then Michael",N
"For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed",N
"Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs",N
"Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly",N
"She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again",N
"'Now don't interrupt,' he would beg of her",N
"'I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven'who is that moving?'eight nine seven, dot and carry seven'don't speak, my own'and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door'quiet, child'dot and carry child'there, you've done it!'did I say nine nine seven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?'",N

"There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse",N
"Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr",N
"Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse",N
"As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her",N
"She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses",N
She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse,N
"How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry",N
Of course her kennel was in the nursery,N
She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat,N
"She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on",N
"It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed",N
"On John's footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain",N
There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait,N
"They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference",N
"They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk",N
She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs,N
"Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair",N
Nana also troubled him in another way,N
He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him,N
"""I know she admires you tremendously, George,"" Mrs",N
"Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father",N
"Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join",N
"Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never see ten again",N
The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was Mrs,N
"Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it",N
There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan,N
Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds,N
"It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day",N
"If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her",N
It is quite like tidying up drawers,N
"You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight",Y
"When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on",N
I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind,N
"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time",N
"There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose",N
"It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still",N
Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal,N
"John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it",N
"John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together",N
"John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth",N
On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles,N
"We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more",N
"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed",N
"When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real",N
That is why there are night-lights,N
Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs,N
"Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter",N
"She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him",N
"The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs",N
Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance,N
